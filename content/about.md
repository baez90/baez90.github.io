My name's Peter. I'm a passionate software developer especially interested in all kind of networking stuff but also asynchronous data processing, software architecture, testing and automatic software quality analysis and many more.

I'm the author of [InetMock](https://gitlab.com/inetmock/inetmock) and [Goveal](https://github.com/baez90/goveal) (more on [projects](/projects)) but I'm also trying to contribute to other open source projects.
